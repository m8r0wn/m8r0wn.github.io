                    <p>
                        LinkedIn is the world’s largest professional networking platform and used every day for recruiting, marketing,
                        and connecting. However, it’s because of this that LinkedIn is also a great source for information gathering
                        during penetration testing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Through a company’s profile, it’s possible to collect a list of current employees and their position.
                        This information can lead to spear phishing, password spraying, or other attacks against the organization.
                        While there are various opensource tools to help collect and weaponize this information, I have always
                        found one reason or anther to perform this process manually. <i>Until now…</i>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Introducing CrossLinked</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://github.com/m8r0wn/CrossLinked">CrossLinked</a> was created to simplify the process
                        of finding current users of an organization through LinkedIn. It does this without API keys, credentials,
                        or ever actually interacting with the site directly.
                        <br><br>
                        Instead, CrossLinked uses specially crafted search engine queries to scrape valid employees names from
                        the resulting LinkedIn data. Once extracted, it will format these names according to the command-line
                        arguments specified. Usernames can then be used in further attacks targeting the organization.

                    </p>

                    <h3>Requirements</h3>
                    <p>
                        CrossLinked assumes the organization’s user account naming convention has already been identified
                        through open source intelligence gathering, or other means. If you’re having trouble with this step,
                        I recently release an article discussing techniques to find this
                        <a href="https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/hacking-organizations-one-document-at-a-time-with-metadata-1af2eb10f254">information
                            through metadata</a> that may be useful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the account naming convention is found, it can be applied through the following notation. This
                        allows names to be turned into email addresses, domain accounts, or written plainly to file:
                        <pre><code class="bash">> python3 crosslinked.py -f '{first}.{last}@company.com' 'Company'
> python3 crosslinked.py -f 'domain\{f}{last}' 'Test Company'
> python3 crosslinked.py -f '{first}{l}@xyz.com' 'Org XYZ'</code></pre>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Demo</h3>
                    <p>
                        The screenshot below demonstrates <a href="https://github.com/m8r0wn/CrossLinked">CrossLinked</a> executed against
                        an example organization. By default, search queries will be displayed on screen with the number of results discovered
                        in each request. Once execution is complete, names will be checked for duplicates and written to a names.txt file
                        in the current directory.
                    </p>
                    <img src="/posts/2021/01/enum.png" class="post_pic center">

                    <p>
                        <bold>Pro Tip:</bold> For best results, put the company name in quotes and
                        use the name as it appears on LinkedIn. Do not use the organization’s domain name.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Defensive Measures</h3>
                    <p>
                        CrossLinked takes advantage of the information collected by search engines about employees mapped to
                        an organization on LinkedIn. As shown, it’s possible to derive this information without scraping the
                        site directly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        LinkedIn enumeration in general, whether by search engine scraping or other means, is a difficult
                        problem to solve. Stopping exposure of this information requires users to subscribe to the threat
                        model and manually modify the privacy settings in their own account. This means their profiles are
                        less discoverable to future opportunities on the platform and, therefore, remediation is less likely to occur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Taking a different approach, there will always be another vector for gathering this type of information.
                        If not LinkedIn, potential usernames could be attained through breach data, alternate social media
                        sources, or any number of techniques. It is recommended organizations be aware of this and employ the
                        proper security solutions to detect and respond to threat activity on their networks.
                    </p>
